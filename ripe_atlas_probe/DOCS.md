# Ripe Atlas Probe Addon

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Add my repository to you homeassistant addon store.
2. Find the Ripe Atlas Probe in the listing and install.
3. Before start DISABLE addon Protection mode.
4. Start the addon.

## How to use

On the first run the addon needs to create you probe keys.
After a first run you can restart the addon and then see your public key in the logs.
Now you need to use this key to register you probe at RIPE Atlas.
[Apply for your RIPE Atlas probe](https://atlas.ripe.net/apply/swprobe/)


In order to recover the same probe with the same credentials you need to take a snapshot. 
At least partial only for this addon.


To reinstall your same probe on a new system, restore your supervisor snapshot from the homeassitant. 
A partial restore of this addon can also be made. 
And if necessary, after recovery, update the addon.
